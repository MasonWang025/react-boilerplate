# react-boilerplate

A ready-to-go React web app with navigation, Bootstrap, and some Node-SASS files all pre-configured.
This is a **refined version of my most-used CRA project structure**. I almost always spend hours just on setting up what is essentially the same CRA project.

# Contents

## Navigation

1. **React router implemented** under `App.js` and `index.js`. Simply modify the `routes` list for any website structure.
2. **Styled navigation bar** that I commonly use. Extremely customized Bootstrap scrollbar (added JS and CSS for UI and UX).

## Styles

1. **Easy media queries** in `breakpoints.scss` (modified from Eduardo Boucas's files). Breakpoints are setup as Bootstrap's official breakpoints.
2. **SASS file structure set up** under `src/styles/`, with `App.scss` importing other files and `variables.scss`.
3. **Bootstrap** CSS and JS for easy grids, `normalize.css`, and nice defaults.
4. **Other CSS customizations** found in `other.scss`.

# Usage

## Using Template

Use template by clicking ```Use this template```.

Otherwise, copy over `public.html` and the `src` folder -> `npm i react-router-dom node-sass jquery --save`.
