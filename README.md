# react-boilerplate

A ready-to-go React web app with navigation, Bootstrap, and some Node-SASS files all pre-configured.
This is a **refined version of my most-used CRA project structure**. I almost always spend hours just on setting up what is essentially the same CRA project.

# Contents

## Navigation

1. **React router implemented** under `App.js` and `index.js`. Simply modify the `routes` list for any website structure.

## SASS

1. **Easy media queries** in `breakpoints.scss` (modified from Eduardo Boucas's files). Breakpoints are setup as Bootstrap's official breakpoints.
2. **SASS file structure set up** under `src/styles/`, with `App.scss` importing other files and `variables.scss`.
3. **Other CSS customizations** found in `other.scss`.

# Usage

## Running Repo Code

```
git clone https://github.com/MasonWang025/react-boilerplate.git
npm i
npm start
```

## My Usage

Copy over the `src` folder, and run `npm i react-router-dom node-sass --save`.
