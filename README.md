# react-boilerplate

A ready-to-go React web app with navigation, Bootstrap, and some Node-SASS files all pre-configured.
This is a **refined version of my most-used CRA project structure**. I almost always spend hours just on setting up what is essentially the same CRA project.

# Contents

## JSX Components

1. Set up the `App.js` and `index.js` to **support navigation** with `react-router-dom` components. Simply modify the `routes` dictionary contents in `App.js` for any web app structure.
2. Add `ScrollToTop.js` to make sure to **scroll to top** on all route changes.
3. Add some **basic components** such as the about page, header, and footer.

# Usage

## Running Repo Code

```
git clone https://github.com/MasonWang025/react-boilerplate.git
npm i
npm start
```

## My Usage

Copy over the `src` folder, and run `npm i react-router-dom node-sass --save`.
